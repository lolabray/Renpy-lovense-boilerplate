## Ren'Py Lovense Boilerplate - For Visual Novels that Vibe!

All original code included with this boilerplate comes from Ren'Py (default empty project).

**Set Up:**

 1. Download **Ren'Py v.8.0** *(Have not yet tested with previous
    versions, see below.)*
 2. Create a Ren'Py project then Clone the Repo, replace the new **script.rpy** and **screens.rpy** with the ones in your project.
 3. Open a console window, navigate to your main game file and install
    Requests for python 
    > pip install requests

 4. Launch Project, enter Lovense toy info and test your connectivity.

**For previous versions of Ren'Py:**

Copy only the new script.rpy into your project file

**Once set up, you can edit the project the way you'd like.** 

Let me know if you end up using the boilerplate or code, I would love to compile a list of VNs for this README.

If you need any help, get in touch!
